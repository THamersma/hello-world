# hello-world
New repository for the GitHub tutorial 'Hello World'

Hi there,

My name is Thomas, I'm Dutch and I'm new to GitHub and programming for that matter.
I've got a bachelor's degree in Biology, but I've taken an interest in the world of programming.
I've started out with HTML, CSS, JS, JQ and LESS. I've learned a lot, but it has been quite unstructured so far.
That's why I started with the Odin Project, which lead me here. So here I am!

Cheers,
Thomas
